## PRNG with rule 30

This is my final presentation of the course of Advanced Algorithm. It is about **Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)** and **Celluear Automation (CA)**.

### 1. Structure

There are totally 4 directories, i.e, **NIST** for NIST randomness test, **PRNG** for different PRNGs including *Rule 30*, **reference** for somthing to refer and **utils** for some tools.
